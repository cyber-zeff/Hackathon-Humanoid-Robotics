# 3.1: LiDAR

## What is LiDAR?

LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. These light pulses—combined with other data recorded by the airborne system— generate precise, three-dimensional information about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics.

A LiDAR instrument principally consists of a laser, a scanner, and a specialized GPS receiver. Airplanes and helicopters are the most commonly used platforms for acquiring LiDAR data over broad areas.

## How does it work?

LiDAR follows a simple principle. A laser emits a pulse of light, which travels to a target object. The light reflects off the object and returns to the LiDAR sensor. The sensor measures the time it takes for the light to travel to the object and back. Since the speed of light is constant, the distance to the object can be calculated using the following formula:

`Distance = (Speed of Light * Time of Flight) / 2`

The LiDAR system does this millions of times per second, creating a dense point cloud of the surrounding environment.

## LiDAR in Humanoid Robotics

In humanoid robotics, LiDAR is a crucial sensor for perception and navigation. It provides a 360-degree view of the robot's surroundings, allowing it to:

*   **Map the environment:** Create detailed 3D maps of its surroundings.
*   **Localize itself:** Determine its position and orientation within the map.
*   **Detect obstacles:** Identify and avoid obstacles in its path.
*   **Recognize objects:** In some cases, LiDAR data can be used to recognize and classify objects.

There are different types of LiDAR sensors used in robotics, with varying ranges, resolutions, and fields of view. The choice of LiDAR sensor depends on the specific application and the robot's requirements.

## Example of a LiDAR point cloud

This image shows a point cloud generated by a LiDAR sensor, capturing the 3D structure of a street scene. Each point in the cloud represents a single laser measurement.
