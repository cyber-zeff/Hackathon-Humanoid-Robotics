# 3.4: Force/Torque Sensors

## Understanding Force and Torque

In the context of robotics, **force** is a push or pull on an object, while **torque** is a twisting force that tends to cause rotation. Measuring these forces is critical for a robot to interact safely and effectively with its environment.

## What are Force/Torque Sensors?

A Force/Torque (F/T) sensor is a device that measures both force and torque applied to it. These sensors are typically mounted on a robot's wrist, ankle, or other joints to measure the forces and torques exerted by the robot's limbs.

## How they work

Most F/T sensors are based on strain gauges. When a force or torque is applied to the sensor, it deforms slightly. This deformation is measured by strain gauges, which are small electrical conductors whose resistance changes when they are stretched or compressed. By measuring the change in resistance of multiple strain gauges arranged in a specific pattern, the sensor can calculate the applied forces and torques along and about three orthogonal axes.

## Applications in Humanoid Robotics

F/T sensors are essential for enabling humanoid robots to perform delicate and complex tasks that require interaction with the environment.

*   **Force Control:** F/T sensors allow for force control, where the robot can apply a specific amount of force to an object. This is crucial for tasks like assembly, polishing, or any task that requires contact with a surface.
*   **Safe Human-Robot Interaction:** By measuring the forces at the point of contact, a robot can detect when it has collided with a person or object and stop or move away to avoid causing injury or damage.
*   **Grasping and Manipulation:** F/T sensors in a robot's hand or wrist provide feedback on the forces being applied to an object during grasping. This helps the robot to hold objects with the right amount of force, without crushing them or letting them slip.
*   **Walking and Balance:** F/T sensors in the robot's feet and ankles measure the ground reaction forces. This information is used to control the robot's balance and gait while walking on different types of terrain.
