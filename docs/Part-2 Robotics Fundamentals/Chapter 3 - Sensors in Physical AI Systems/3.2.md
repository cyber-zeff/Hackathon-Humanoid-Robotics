# 3.2: Cameras

## The Role of Cameras in Robotics

Cameras are one of a humanoid robot's most important sensors, providing rich visual information about the environment. They are essential for a wide range of tasks, from simple object detection to complex scene understanding.

## Types of Cameras

Several types of cameras are used in robotics, each with its own strengths and weaknesses:

*   **Monocular Cameras:** A single camera that provides a 2D projection of the 3D world. They are inexpensive and widely available, but it is difficult to infer depth from a single image.
*   **Stereo Cameras:** A pair of cameras separated by a known distance. By comparing the images from the two cameras, it is possible to calculate depth information and create a 3D representation of the scene.
*   **Depth Cameras:** These cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect or Intel RealSense, directly measure depth using techniques like structured light or time-of-flight. They provide a dense depth map of the scene, which is very useful for navigation and manipulation.
*   **Event Cameras:** These are bio-inspired sensors that only report changes in brightness at the pixel level. They have a very high dynamic range and temporal resolution, making them suitable for high-speed and challenging lighting conditions.

## Computer Vision

The data from cameras is processed using computer vision algorithms to extract meaningful information. Some common computer vision tasks in robotics include:

*   **Object Detection and Recognition:** Identifying and classifying objects in the scene.
*   **Semantic Segmentation:** Labeling each pixel in an image with a semantic category (e.g., person, car, road).
*   **Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping):** Using camera data to build a map of the environment and simultaneously track the robot's position within it.
*   **Visual Servoing:** Using visual feedback to control the robot's movements.

## Cameras in Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are often equipped with multiple cameras, including a stereo pair in the head to mimic human vision. These cameras are used for:

*   **Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance:** Seeing and avoiding obstacles.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction:** Recognizing faces, gestures, and emotions.
*   **Manipulation:** Visually guiding the hand to grasp and manipulate objects.
