# 3.3: IMU Sensors

## What is an IMU?

An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers.

## Components of an IMU

*   **Accelerometer:** Measures linear acceleration. In a static condition, it measures the gravitational acceleration, which can be used to determine the device's orientation with respect to the vertical axis.
*   **Gyroscope:** Measures angular velocity. By integrating the angular velocity over time, the change in orientation can be calculated.
*   **Magnetometer:** Measures the Earth's magnetic field. This can be used to determine the device's heading (direction) with respect to the magnetic north.

## How IMUs work in Robotics

IMUs are fundamental for controlling the balance and motion of humanoid robots. They provide crucial information about the robot's orientation and movement. The data from the IMU is used in a process called **sensor fusion**, often using a Kalman filter or a similar algorithm, to combine the measurements from the different sensors and provide a more accurate and stable estimate of the robot's state.

## Applications in Humanoid Robotics

*   **Balancing:** The primary use of an IMU in a humanoid robot is to maintain balance. By measuring the robot's orientation and angular velocity, the control system can make adjustments to the robot's joints to keep it from falling over. This is especially critical during walking, running, or when the robot is pushed.
*   **State Estimation:** IMUs are used to estimate the robot's state, including its orientation (roll, pitch, yaw), position, and velocity. This information is essential for navigation and control.
*   **Motion Tracking:** IMUs can be placed on different parts of the robot's body to track their motion. This is useful for tasks like gesture recognition and imitation learning.
