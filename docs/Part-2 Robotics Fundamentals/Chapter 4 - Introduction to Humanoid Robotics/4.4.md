# 4.4: Dynamics Overview

## What is Dynamics?

Dynamics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the study of forces and their effect on motion. In robotics, dynamics is used to describe the relationship between the forces and torques applied to the robot's joints and the resulting motion of the robot.

## Forward Dynamics

Forward dynamics is the problem of finding the resulting acceleration of the robot's joints given the forces and torques applied to them. This can be thought of as simulating the motion of the robot.

The equations of motion for a robot can be written in the following form:

`M(q) * q_ddot + C(q, q_dot) * q_dot + G(q) = tau`

where:
*   `q`, `q_dot`, and `q_ddot` are the joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, respectively.
*   `M(q)` is the mass matrix, which describes the inertia of the robot.
*   `C(q, q_dot)` is the Coriolis and centrifugal matrix.
*   `G(q)` is the gravity vector.
*   `tau` is the vector of joint torques.

## Inverse Dynamics

Inverse dynamics is the problem of finding the joint torques required to achieve a desired acceleration of the robot's joints. This is a crucial problem in robot control, as it allows the control system to calculate the motor commands needed to execute a desired motion.

Inverse dynamics is computationally more efficient than forward dynamics and is widely used in model-based control schemes for humanoid robots, such as computed torque control.

## Dynamics in Humanoid Robotics

Understanding the dynamics of a humanoid robot is essential for:

*   **Control:** Designing controllers that can make the robot walk, run, and perform other dynamic tasks.
*   **Simulation:** Creating realistic simulations of the robot's motion.
*   **Design:** Optimizing the robot's design for performance and energy efficiency.
