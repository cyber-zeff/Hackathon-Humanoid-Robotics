# 4.3: Kinematics Overview

## What is Kinematics?

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion. In robotics, kinematics is used to describe the relationship between the robot's joint positions and the position and orientation of its end-effector (e.g., its hand or foot).

## Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics is the problem of finding the position and orientation of the end-effector given the values of the robot's joint angles. This is a relatively straightforward problem that can be solved using a set of equations that describe the geometry of the robot.

For a simple 2D robotic arm with two joints, the forward kinematics equations would be:

```
x = L1 * cos(theta1) + L2 * cos(theta1 + theta2)
y = L1 * sin(theta1) + L2 * sin(theta1 + theta2)
```

where `L1` and `L2` are the lengths of the two links, and `theta1` and `theta2` are the joint angles.

## Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics is the reverse problem: finding the joint angles that will place the end-effector at a desired position and orientation. This is a much more difficult problem than forward kinematics, as it often involves solving a set of non-linear equations.

For many robots, there may be multiple solutions to the inverse kinematics problem, or there may be no solution at all if the desired position is outside the robot's workspace.

Inverse kinematics is essential for many robotics tasks, such as reaching for an object or following a trajectory.
