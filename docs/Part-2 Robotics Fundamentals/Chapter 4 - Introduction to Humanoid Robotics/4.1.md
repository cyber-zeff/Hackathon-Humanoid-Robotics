# 4.1: What Makes a Robot Humanoid?

## The Definition of a Humanoid Robot

A humanoid robot is a robot with its body shape built to resemble the human body. The design may be for functional purposes, such as interacting with human tools and environments, for experimental purposes, such as the study of bipedal locomotion, or for other purposes.

In general, humanoid robots have a torso, a head, two arms, and two legs, though some forms of humanoid robots may model only part of the body, for example, from the waist up.

## Key Characteristics

While there is a wide variety of humanoid robots, they generally share some common characteristics:

*   **Bipedal Locomotion:** The ability to walk on two legs is a defining feature of humanoid robots. This is a challenging engineering problem, as it requires dynamic balancing and coordination.
*   **Human-like Morphology:** The robot's body plan is similar to that of a human, with a head, torso, arms, and legs. This allows the robot to operate in environments designed for humans and use human tools.
*   **Human-like Sensing:** Humanoid robots are often equipped with sensors that mimic human senses, such as stereo cameras for vision, microphones for hearing, and tactile sensors for touch.
*   **Human-like Manipulation:** The robot's hands and arms are designed to manipulate objects in a way that is similar to human manipulation. This may include grasping, pushing, pulling, and other fine motor skills.

## Why Build Humanoid Robots?

The development of humanoid robots is driven by several motivations:

*   **To work in human environments:** Since our world is built for humans, a robot with a human-like body can navigate and work in it more easily than a robot with a different form factor.
*   **To interact with humans:** A human-like form can make it easier for people to interact with and accept robots.
*   **To study human intelligence:** By building robots that can perform human-like tasks, we can learn more about how the human brain and body work.
*   **To perform tasks that are dangerous or difficult for humans:** Humanoid robots can be used in applications such as disaster response, space exploration, and elderly care.
