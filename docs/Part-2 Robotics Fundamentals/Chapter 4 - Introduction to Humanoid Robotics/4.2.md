# 4.2: Degrees of Freedom (DoF)

## What are Degrees of Freedom?

In mechanics, the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a mechanical system is the number of independent parameters that define its configuration. In the context of robotics, the DoF of a robot is the number of independent joints that it has.

For example, a simple robotic arm with a shoulder joint that can move up and down and an elbow joint that can bend has two degrees of freedom.

## DoF in Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are complex systems with many degrees of freedom. A typical humanoid robot can have anywhere from 20 to 50 DoF. These DoF are distributed throughout the robot's body, including the legs, arms, torso, and head.

*   **Legs:** The legs of a humanoid robot typically have at least 6 DoF each, with 3 at the hip, 1 at the knee, and 2 at the ankle. This allows for a wide range of motion for walking, running, and balancing.
*   **Arms:** The arms also have a high number of DoF, often 7 or more per arm. This allows for dexterous manipulation and reaching.
*   **Torso:** The torso may have several DoF to allow for bending and twisting, which is important for balance and whole-body motion.
*   **Head:** The head typically has 2 or 3 DoF to allow the robot to look around and direct its gaze.

## The Importance of DoF

The number of DoF of a robot determines its dexterity and maneuverability. A robot with more DoF can move in more complex ways and perform more intricate tasks. However, controlling a robot with a high number of DoF is also more challenging. The control system must coordinate the motion of all the joints to achieve the desired behavior.

## Redundancy

When a robot has more DoF than is necessary to perform a task, it is said to be redundant. For example, a 7-DoF arm is redundant for simply positioning its hand in 3D space (which only requires 3 DoF). This redundancy can be used to avoid obstacles, optimize for energy consumption, or satisfy other constraints.
