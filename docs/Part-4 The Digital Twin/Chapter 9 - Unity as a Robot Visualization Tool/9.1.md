# 9.1: Why use Unity?

## What is Unity?

Unity is a popular real-time 3D development platform. It is widely used for creating games, simulations, and other interactive experiences. While Gazebo is a powerful tool for physics simulation, Unity offers several advantages for robot visualization.

## Advantages of Unity for Visualization

*   **High-fidelity graphics:** Unity's rendering engine is designed for creating high-quality, realistic graphics. This makes it a great choice for creating visually appealing simulations and visualizations of your robot.
*   **Rich ecosystem:** Unity has a large and active community and a vast asset store with a wide range of models, textures, and tools that you can use to create your virtual environment.
*   **Cross-platform support:** Unity can build to a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. This makes it easy to create visualizations that can be viewed on different devices.
*   **C# programming:** Unity uses the C# programming language, which is a modern, object-oriented language that is easy to learn and use.

## Unity vs. Gazebo

It is important to understand that Unity and Gazebo are not mutually exclusive. They can be used together to create a powerful robotics development pipeline.

*   **Gazebo** is best suited for **physics simulation**. It provides a robust and accurate physics engine that is essential for developing and testing control algorithms.
*   **Unity** is best suited for **visualization**. It allows you to create high-quality, interactive visualizations of your robot and its environment.

A common workflow is to run the physics simulation in Gazebo and then use Unity to visualize the robot's motion. This can be done by streaming the robot's state from Gazebo to Unity using ROS.
