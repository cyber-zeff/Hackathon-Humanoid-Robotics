# 9.2: Importing Robot Models

## Importing from URDF

While Unity does not natively support URDF, there are tools available that allow you to import a URDF model into a Unity scene. One popular tool is the [URDF-importer](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/URDF-importer) ROS package, which was created for this purpose, but has since been deprecated. The officialy supported package is now the [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub).

This tool will parse the URDF file and create a corresponding model in Unity, with all the links and joints correctly configured.

## Importing Meshes

The visual meshes of your robot model can be imported into Unity as assets. Unity supports a wide variety of mesh formats, including FBX, OBJ, and DAE.

Once imported, you can apply materials and textures to the meshes to give your robot a realistic appearance.

## Configuring Joints

After importing the robot model, you will need to configure the joints in Unity. This involves setting the joint types, limits, and other properties.

The URDF importer will typically handle this for you, but you may need to make some manual adjustments to get the desired behavior.
