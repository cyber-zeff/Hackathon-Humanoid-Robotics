# 9.4: ROS-Unity Integration

## Unity Robotics Hub

The [Unity Robotics Hub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub) is a set of packages that provide support for ROS 2 in Unity. These packages allow you to:

*   **Publish and subscribe to ROS 2 topics:** Send and receive messages from ROS 2 nodes.
*   **Call ROS 2 services:** Call services provided by ROS 2 nodes.
*   **Get and set ROS 2 parameters:** Get and set parameters on ROS 2 nodes.

## Setting up the ROS-Unity Connection

To connect a Unity scene to a ROS 2 network, you need to add the `ROSConnection` component to a game object in the scene. This component will handle the communication between Unity and ROS 2.

You will need to specify the IP address of the ROS 2 master and the port number to use for the connection.

## Example: Visualizing Robot State

A common use case for ROS-Unity integration is to visualize the state of a robot in Unity. This can be done by:

1.  **In ROS:** A ROS node publishes the robot's joint states to a topic (e.g., `/joint_states`).
2.  **In Unity:** A C# script subscribes to the `/joint_states` topic and updates the joint angles of the robot model in Unity based on the received messages.

This allows you to see a real-time visualization of the robot's motion in a high-fidelity Unity environment, while the robot's control and physics are being simulated in ROS and Gazebo.
