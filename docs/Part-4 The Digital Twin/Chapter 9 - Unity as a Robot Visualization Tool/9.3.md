# 9.3: High-Fidelity Rendering

## Materials and Textures

Unity's material system allows you to create realistic-looking materials for your robot model. You can use textures to add detail and color to the surfaces of your robot.

Unity supports a variety of shaders, which are small programs that run on the GPU and determine how an object is rendered. You can use a physically-based rendering (PBR) shader to create materials that accurately reflect light, resulting in a very realistic appearance.

## Lighting

Good lighting is essential for creating a high-fidelity rendering. Unity provides a variety of light types, including:

*   **Directional lights:** Used to simulate a distant light source, such as the sun.
*   **Point lights:** Used to simulate a light source that emits light in all directions, such as a light bulb.
*   **Spotlights:** Used to simulate a light source that emits light in a cone, such as a flashlight.

You can also use global illumination to create more realistic lighting, with soft shadows and indirect lighting.

## Post-Processing

Post-processing effects are applied to the rendered image after it has been drawn. They can be used to add a variety of effects, such as:

*   **Bloom:** Makes bright areas of the image glow.
*   **Depth of field:** Blurs objects that are not in focus.
*   **Color grading:** Adjusts the colors of the image to create a specific mood or look.

By combining these techniques, you can create stunning, high-fidelity visualizations of your robot in Unity.
