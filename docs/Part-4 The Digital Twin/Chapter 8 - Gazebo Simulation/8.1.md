# 8.1: Setting up Gazebo

## What is Gazebo?

Gazebo is a powerful 3D robotics simulator that allows you to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments. It provides a robust physics engine, high-quality graphics, and convenient programmatic and graphical interfaces.

Gazebo is a standalone application, but it is tightly integrated with ROS. The `gazebo_ros_pkgs` package provides a set of ROS 2 packages for interfacing with Gazebo.

## Installing Gazebo

Gazebo is not included in the standard ROS 2 installation. You will need to install it separately. The installation instructions vary depending on your operating system. You can find detailed instructions on the Gazebo website.

## Launching Gazebo

You can launch Gazebo from the command line:

```bash
gazebo
```

This will open the Gazebo GUI. You can also launch Gazebo from a ROS 2 launch file, which is the recommended way to use Gazebo with ROS.

## The Gazebo GUI

The Gazebo GUI has several components:

*   **The 3D View:** This is the main view where you can see the simulated world.
*   **The Scene Tree:** This shows a hierarchical view of all the models in the world.
*   **The Palettes:** These provide tools for inserting models, controlling the simulation, and more.

## Spawning a Robot

To spawn a robot in Gazebo, you need to have a model of the robot in SDF format. You can then use the `ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py` command to spawn the robot in the simulation.

```bash
ros2 run gazebo_ros spawn_entity.py -entity my_robot -file my_robot.sdf
```

This will load the `my_robot.sdf` file and add the robot to the simulation.
