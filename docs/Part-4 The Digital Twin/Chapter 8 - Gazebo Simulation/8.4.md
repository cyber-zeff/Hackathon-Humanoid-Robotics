# 8.4: World Files

## What is a World File?

A Gazebo world file is an SDF file that describes the entire simulated environment. It can include:

*   **Robots:** One or more robots.
*   **Static objects:** Buildings, furniture, and other static objects.
*   **Lights:** Light sources to illuminate the scene.
*   **Physics properties:** The physics properties of the world, such as gravity.
*   **Environmental properties:** The properties of the environment, such as the sky and fog.

## Creating a World File

You can create a world file by writing an SDF file. You can start with an empty world and then add models to it, or you can start with an existing world and modify it.

Gazebo provides a set of example world files that you can use as a starting point.

Here is an example of a simple world file that contains a ground plane and a sun:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<sdf version="1.6">
  <world name="default">
    <include>
      <uri>model://ground_plane</uri>
    </include>
    <include>
      <uri>model://sun</uri>
    </include>
  </world>
</sdf>
```

## Launching a World

You can launch a world file using the `gazebo` command:

```bash
gazebo my_world.world
```

You can also launch a world file from a ROS 2 launch file. The `gazebo_ros` package provides a `GazeboRos` action that makes it easy to launch Gazebo with a world file.

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from launch.actions import ExecuteProcess

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        ExecuteProcess(
            cmd=['gazebo', '--verbose', 'my_world.world', '-s', 'libgazebo_ros_init.so'],
            output='screen'
        ),
        # ... other nodes ...
    ])
```
