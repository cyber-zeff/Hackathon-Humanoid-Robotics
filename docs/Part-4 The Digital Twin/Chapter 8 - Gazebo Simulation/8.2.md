# 8.2: Robot Physics Simulation

## The Physics Engine

Gazebo uses a physics engine to simulate the motion of robots and objects in the world. The default physics engine is ODE (Open Dynamics Engine), but Gazebo also supports other engines such as Bullet, Simbody, and DART.

The physics engine is responsible for:

*   **Gravity:** Applying gravity to all the objects in the world.
*   **Collisions:** Detecting and resolving collisions between objects.
*   **Joint constraints:** Enforcing the constraints of the robot's joints.
*   **Friction:** Simulating friction between surfaces.

## Tuning the Physics Properties

You can tune the physics properties of your robot and the environment to make the simulation more realistic. These properties are specified in the SDF file.

Some of the key physics properties that you can tune are:

*   **Mass and inertia:** The mass and inertia of each link.
*   **Friction:** The friction coefficient of each surface.
*   **Damping:** The damping of each joint.
*   **Gravity:** The gravity vector of the world.

## Contact Sensors

Gazebo can simulate contact sensors, which provide information about the forces and torques acting on a link due to contact with other objects. This is useful for tasks such as grasping and walking.

You can add a contact sensor to your robot model by adding a `<sensor>` element to a link in the SDF file.
