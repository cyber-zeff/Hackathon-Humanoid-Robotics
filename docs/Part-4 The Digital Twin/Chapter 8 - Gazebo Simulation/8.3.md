# 8.3: Sensor Simulation

Gazebo can simulate a wide variety of sensors, including:

*   **Cameras:** Monocular, stereo, and depth cameras.
*   **LiDARs:** 2D and 3D LiDARs.
*   **IMUs:** Inertial Measurement Units.
*   **GPS:** Global Positioning System.
*   **Contact sensors:** Sensors that detect contact with other objects.
*   **Force/Torque sensors:** Sensors that measure forces and torques.

## Adding a Sensor to a Model

To add a sensor to your robot model, you need to add a `<sensor>` element to a link in the SDF file. The `<sensor>` element specifies the type of the sensor, its properties, and a plugin that will be used to simulate the sensor.

Here is an example of a camera sensor in an SDF file:

```xml
<sensor name="camera" type="camera">
  <camera>
    <horizontal_fov>1.047</horizontal_fov>
    <image>
      <width>640</width>
      <height>480</height>
    </image>
    <clip>
      <near>0.1</near>
      <far>100</far>
    </clip>
  </camera>
  <plugin name="camera_controller" filename="libgazebo_ros_camera.so">
    <cameraName>camera</cameraName>
    <imageTopicName>image_raw</imageTopicName>
    <cameraInfoTopicName>camera_info</cameraInfoTopicName>
  </plugin>
</sensor>
```

## Sensor Plugins

Sensor plugins are used to simulate the behavior of a sensor and to publish its data to a ROS 2 topic. Gazebo provides a set of standard sensor plugins for common sensors. You can also write your own custom sensor plugins.

The `gazebo_ros_pkgs` package provides a set of plugins that publish sensor data as ROS 2 messages. For example, the `libgazebo_ros_camera.so` plugin publishes images from a simulated camera to a ROS 2 topic.
