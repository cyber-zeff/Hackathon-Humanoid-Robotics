# 18.2: Safety

## The Paramount Importance of Safety in HRI

When robots, especially large and powerful humanoid robots, operate in close proximity to humans, safety becomes the most critical design and operational consideration. Any interaction must ensure the well-being of humans, prevent damage to the robot or environment, and build trust.

## Key Principles for Robot Safety

1.  **Safety-by-Design:**
    *   **Physical Design:** Robots should be designed with rounded edges, compliant materials, and limited force/speed capabilities where appropriate.
    *   **Hardware Safety:** Emergency stop buttons (E-stops) and safety-rated sensors (e.g., laser scanners, safety mats) are essential to detect human presence and prevent collisions.
    *   **Intrinsic Safety:** Robots should have inherent limitations on their power, speed, or movement range to prevent harm even if control fails.

2.  **Safety Control Systems:**
    *   **Collision Detection and Avoidance:** Robots must be able to detect imminent collisions with humans or objects and react appropriately (e.g., stop, deflect, or slow down).
    *   **Force and Torque Limits:** Control systems should enforce strict limits on the forces and torques the robot can exert, especially during contact with humans. Compliant control (as discussed in Chapter 17) is crucial here.
    *   **Safe State:** The robot should be able to revert to a known safe state (e.g., shut down, retract limbs) in case of an anomaly or emergency.

3.  **Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) Safety Standards:**
    *   International standards like ISO 10218 and ISO/TS 15066 provide guidelines for safe robot operation, especially in collaborative settings. These cover topics like speed and separation monitoring, power and force limiting, and hand guiding.

4.  **Predictability and Transparency:**
    *   Robots should behave predictably. Sudden, unexpected movements can cause alarm or injury.
    *   The robot's intentions should be transparent to humans (e.g., using lights, sounds, or visual cues to indicate what it's about to do).

## Risk Assessment

Before deploying any humanoid robot in an environment with humans, a thorough risk assessment must be conducted. This involves identifying potential hazards, evaluating the likelihood and severity of harm, and implementing measures to mitigate those risks to an acceptable level.

Ensuring robot safety is an ongoing process that involves careful design, robust control, adherence to standards, and continuous monitoring.
