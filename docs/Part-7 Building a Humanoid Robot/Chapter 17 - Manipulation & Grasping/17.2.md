# 17.2: Object Manipulation

## The Goal of Robotic Manipulation

Object manipulation is the process by which a robot uses its end-effector (hand or gripper) to interact with and change the state of objects in its environment. This can involve picking up, placing, moving, assembling, or using tools. For humanoid robots, effective manipulation is key to operating in human-centric environments.

## Core Manipulation Tasks

1.  **Grasping:** The act of securely holding an object. This is often the first step in most manipulation tasks and involves planning a stable grasp pose.
2.  **Reaching:** Moving the robot's arm and hand to a desired pre-grasp pose near the object. This involves solving inverse kinematics (IK) and often trajectory planning to avoid obstacles.
3.  **Placing:** Releasing an object at a target location with a desired orientation.
4.  **Pushing/Pulling:** Interacting with objects without a full grasp, useful for reorienting or moving large items.
5.  **Assembly:** Combining multiple parts to create a larger object, often requiring high precision and compliance.
6.  **Tool Use:** Manipulating objects using intermediate tools (e.g., screwdrivers, hammers, cooking utensils), which introduces additional layers of planning and control.

## Components of a Manipulation System

A typical robotic manipulation system involves several interconnected modules:

*   **Perception:** Using cameras, depth sensors, and tactile sensors to identify objects, estimate their pose, and detect contact.
*   **Grasp Planning:** Determining *how* to grasp an object, considering its shape, weight, material, and the task requirements.
*   **Motion Planning (Arm):** Generating a collision-free trajectory for the robot arm to move from its current pose to the desired pre-grasp and grasp poses.
*   **Motion Planning (Whole-body):** For humanoids, this often involves coordinating the arm with the torso and legs to maintain balance and extend reach.
*   **Control:** Executing the planned trajectory and adjusting joint torques based on sensor feedback (e.g., force-torque sensors) to achieve compliant interaction.

## Challenges in Manipulation

*   **Uncertainty:** Real-world environments are full of uncertainties (object pose estimation errors, friction variations, unexpected disturbances).
*   **Dexterity vs. Simplicity:** Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands is extremely complex.
*   **Occlusion:** Objects may be partially hidden, making perception and grasping difficult.
*   **Compliance:** The ability to interact with objects and the environment in a soft, adaptive manner without causing damage or instability.

Robust object manipulation is fundamental for humanoid robots to perform a wide array of service tasks and interact meaningfully with their surroundings.
