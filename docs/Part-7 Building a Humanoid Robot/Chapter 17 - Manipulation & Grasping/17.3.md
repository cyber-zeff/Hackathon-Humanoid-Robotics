# 17.3: Grasp Planning

## The Art and Science of Grasping

Grasp planning is the process of computing a stable and feasible way for a robot's gripper or hand to hold an object. A good grasp is one that securely holds the object, allows the robot to perform the intended task, and is robust to uncertainties. For humanoid robots, effective grasp planning is crucial for successful object manipulation.

## Factors in Grasp Planning

Several factors influence the choice and success of a grasp:

1.  **Object Geometry:** The shape, size, and weight distribution of the object are primary determinants.
2.  **Gripper Kinematics:** The design, number of fingers, and range of motion of the robot's hand or gripper.
3.  **Task Requirements:** The subsequent manipulation task influences the grasp. A power grasp might be suitable for carrying, while a precision grasp is needed for tool use.
4.  **Environment:** Obstacles in the environment or constraints on the object's movement can affect feasible grasp poses.
5.  **Force Closure:** A grasp is said to be "force closed" if any external force or torque applied to the object can be resisted by the gripper, preventing the object from slipping. This is a desirable property for stable grasps.
6.  **Form Closure:** A stronger condition where the gripper's fingers "cage" the object such that it cannot move at all, even without friction.

## Approaches to Grasp Planning

1.  **Analytical Approaches:** These methods use geometric and force-based models to compute optimal grasp points. They often rely on simplified models of the object and gripper.
2.  **Data-Driven Approaches (Learning-based):** With the rise of deep learning, robots can learn to grasp objects from demonstrations or large datasets.
    *   **Supervised Learning:** Training a neural network on labeled examples of good and bad grasps.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** The robot learns to grasp through trial and error in simulation, receiving rewards for successful grasps.
3.  **Grasp Quality Metrics:** Algorithms evaluate potential grasps using various metrics, such as:
    *   **Wrench Space Volume:** Measures the range of forces and torques that can be resisted by the grasp.
    *   **Epsilon Metric:** Quantifies how robust the grasp is to small perturbations.
    *   **Distance to Collision:** Ensures the gripper does not collide with the object or environment during the grasp approach.

## Integrating Grasp Planning

Grasp planning is usually integrated into a larger manipulation pipeline. After an object is detected and its pose estimated (perception), the grasp planner generates one or more candidate grasps. These grasps are then evaluated, and a path is planned to execute the chosen grasp. Force-torque and tactile feedback during the grasp execution help ensure its success.
