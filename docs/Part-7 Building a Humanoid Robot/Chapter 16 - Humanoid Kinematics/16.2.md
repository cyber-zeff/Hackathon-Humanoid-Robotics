# 16.2: Balance and Bipedal Locomotion

## The Challenge of Bipedalism

Bipedal locomotion, or walking on two legs, is one of the most challenging aspects of humanoid robotics. Unlike wheeled robots that have a stable base, bipedal robots are inherently unstable. Maintaining balance while walking requires continuous dynamic control.

## Key Concepts for Balance

1.  **Center of Mass (CoM):** The average position of all the mass of the robot. For stable balance, the projection of the CoM onto the ground must remain within the robot's support polygon.
2.  **Support Polygon:** The area on the ground enclosed by the robot's feet (or foot, if only one is on the ground). If the CoM projection falls outside this polygon, the robot will fall.
3.  **Zero Moment Point (ZMP):** A concept used in bipedal locomotion. It is the point on the ground about which the total moment (including inertial and gravitational forces) is zero. For stable walking, the ZMP must remain within the support polygon.

## Control Strategies for Balance

*   **Static Walking:** Used by some early humanoids, where the CoM always remains within the support polygon. This results in slow, often unnatural, walking gaits.
*   **Dynamic Walking:** More advanced and human-like walking, where the CoM can move outside the support polygon. Balance is maintained by actively controlling the ZMP and using whole-body movements.
*   **Preview Control:** A common technique where the robot "looks ahead" in time to predict its future motion and adjust its actions to keep the ZMP within the support polygon.

## Bipedal Locomotion Gaits

Different gaits are used for bipedal locomotion:

*   **Walking:** The most common gait, where at least one foot is always on the ground.
*   **Running:** A more dynamic gait where both feet can be off the ground for short periods.
*   **Stepping:** Used for navigating stairs or uneven terrain.

Achieving robust and energy-efficient bipedal locomotion is a hallmark of advanced humanoid robots, enabling them to navigate complex human environments.
