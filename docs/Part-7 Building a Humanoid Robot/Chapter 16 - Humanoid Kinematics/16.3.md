# 16.3: Zero Moment Point (ZMP)

## Definition of ZMP

The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is a fundamental concept for understanding and controlling the balance of bipedal robots. It is defined as the point on the ground where the net moment of all forces (gravitational forces, inertial forces, and contact forces from the ground) acting on the robot is zero.

In simpler terms, if you imagine the robot being able to pivot on a single point on the ground without falling over, that point would be the ZMP.

## ZMP and Stability

For a bipedal robot to maintain dynamic stability (i.e., not fall over), the ZMP must always remain within the **support polygon**. The support polygon is the convex hull of all the contact points between the robot's feet and the ground.

*   If the ZMP is *within* the support polygon, the robot is dynamically stable.
*   If the ZMP *moves outside* the support polygon, the robot will begin to fall in that direction.

## How ZMP is Used in Control

Robot control systems actively monitor and control the ZMP to achieve stable locomotion.

1.  **Measurement/Estimation:** The ZMP can be estimated from force-torque sensors in the robot's feet or calculated from the robot's joint positions, velocities, and accelerations, along with its known mass properties.
2.  **Trajectory Generation:** When planning a walking gait, a desired ZMP trajectory is often generated first. This trajectory typically stays within the support polygon or moves dynamically within it during walking.
3.  **Feedback Control:** The robot's control system then uses feedback control to adjust joint torques and positions to ensure that the actual ZMP closely tracks the desired ZMP trajectory. This might involve small adjustments to ankle, hip, and torso movements.

## ZMP vs. CoM

While related, ZMP and Center of Mass (CoM) are distinct concepts:

*   **CoM:** The average position of all the robot's mass.
*   **ZMP:** A point on the ground related to the contact forces.

For static stability, the projection of the CoM must be within the support polygon. For dynamic stability, the ZMP must be within the support polygon. In dynamic movements like walking, the CoM can move outside the support polygon, as long as the ZMP remains within it.
