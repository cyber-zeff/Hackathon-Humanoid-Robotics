# 10.4: Isaac ROS

Isaac ROS is a collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages for perception and manipulation. These packages are designed to run on NVIDIA's Jetson platform and leverage the power of NVIDIA GPUs to achieve high performance.

## Key Features

*   **Hardware acceleration:** The Isaac ROS packages are optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs, providing a significant performance boost for computationally intensive tasks such as deep learning and computer vision.
*   **ROS 2 native:** Isaac ROS is built on top of ROS 2, which means that it can be easily integrated into a ROS 2-based robotics application.
*   **GEMs:** The core of Isaac ROS is a set of GPU-accelerated libraries called GEMs. These GEMs provide optimized implementations of common robotics algorithms.

## Available Packages

The Isaac ROS collection includes packages for a variety of tasks, including:

*   **isaac_ros_apriltag:** For detecting AprilTags.
*   **isaac_ros_bi3d:** For stereo depth estimation.
*   **isaac_ros_dnn_inference:** For running deep neural network inference.
*   **isaac_ros_visual_slam:** For visual SLAM.
*   **isaac_ros_object_detection:** For detecting objects using a trained model.

By using the Isaac ROS packages, you can significantly accelerate the perception and manipulation capabilities of your robot, enabling it to perform more complex tasks in real-time.
