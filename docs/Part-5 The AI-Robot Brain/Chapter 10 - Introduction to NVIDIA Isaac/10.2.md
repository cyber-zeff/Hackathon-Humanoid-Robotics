# 10.2: Isaac SDK

The Isaac SDK is a software development kit for building high-performance robotics applications. It is based on a component-based architecture that allows you to create modular and reusable applications.

## Key Features

*   **Component-based architecture:** An Isaac application is built as a graph of components, called **codelets**. Each codelet is a small, reusable piece of code that performs a specific task.
*   **Message passing:** Codelets communicate with each other by passing messages. The Isaac SDK provides a high-performance message passing system that allows for efficient communication between codelets.
*   **GPU acceleration:** The Isaac SDK is designed to take full advantage of NVIDIA GPUs. It provides a set of GPU-accelerated libraries for common robotics tasks, such as computer vision and deep learning.
*   **Carter Robot:** The SDK includes a reference robot platform called Carter, which can be used to get started with building and testing robotics applications.

## Codelets

A codelet is the basic building block of an Isaac application. It has a set of input and output ports for receiving and sending messages.

Here is an example of a simple codelet that adds two numbers:

```c++
class Adder : public isaac::alice::Codelet {
 public:
  void start() override {
    tickPeriodically();
  }

  void tick() override {
    auto in_a = rx_a().get();
    auto in_b = rx_b().get();
    auto out = tx_sum().initProto();
    out.setSum(in_a->getSum() + in_b->getSum());
    tx_sum().publish();
  }

  ISAAC_PROTO_RX(Input, a);
  ISAAC_PROTO_RX(Input, b);
  ISAAC_PROTO_TX(Output, sum);
};

ISAAC_ALICE_REGISTER_CODELET(Adder);
```
## Is the Isaac SDK still supported?

While the Isaac SDK was a powerful tool, NVIDIA is no longer actively developing it. The focus has shifted to **Isaac ROS**, which provides similar hardware acceleration capabilities in a more ROS-native way. For new projects, it is recommended to use Isaac ROS instead of the standalone Isaac SDK.
