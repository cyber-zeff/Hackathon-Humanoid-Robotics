# 10.1: What is NVIDIA Isaac?

NVIDIA Isaac is a powerful platform for developing and deploying AI-powered robots. It consists of a set of tools, libraries, and hardware that accelerate the development of robotics applications.

The Isaac platform includes:

*   **Isaac SDK:** A framework for building high-performance robotics applications.
*   **Isaac Sim:** A realistic robotics simulator based on the NVIDIA Omniverse platform.
*   **Isaac ROS:** A collection of hardware-accelerated ROS 2 packages for perception and manipulation.
*   **Jetson:** A series of embedded computing boards for deploying AI on the edge.

## The Isaac Ecosystem

The Isaac ecosystem is designed to provide an end-to-end solution for robotics development, from simulation and training to deployment and operation.

*   **Simulation:** You can use Isaac Sim to create realistic simulations of your robot and its environment. This allows you to test and train your robot's AI algorithms in a safe and controlled environment before deploying them on a physical robot.
*   **Perception:** Isaac provides a set of tools and libraries for robot perception, including computer vision, object detection, and SLAM.
*   **Manipulation:** Isaac includes tools for robot manipulation, such as motion planning and grasp planning.
*   **Deployment:** Once you have developed and tested your robotics application, you can deploy it on an NVIDIA Jetson embedded platform for real-world operation.

By leveraging the power of NVIDIA GPUs, the Isaac platform enables the development of a new generation of intelligent and autonomous robots.
