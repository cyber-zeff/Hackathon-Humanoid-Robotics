# 11.3: Domain Randomization

## The "Sim-to-Real" Gap

One of the major challenges with using synthetic data is the "sim-to-real" gap. A model trained exclusively on synthetic data may not perform well in the real world because the simulation, no matter how realistic, will always have differences from reality. These differences can be in lighting, textures, physics, sensor noise, and more.

## What is Domain Randomization?

Domain randomization is a technique used to bridge the sim-to-real gap. The core idea is to train the model on a wide variety of simulated environments with randomized properties. By exposing the model to a vast range of visual appearances, it learns to focus on the essential features of the objects it is trying to detect, rather than memorizing the specific details of the simulated environment.

## How it Works

Instead of trying to make the simulation perfectly match the real world, domain randomization embraces the differences and makes them a source of variation. In practice, this involves randomly changing aspects of the simulation for each training image generated.

Things to randomize include:
*   **Lighting:** Position, intensity, and color of lights.
*   **Textures:** Applying random textures to objects and the background.
*   **Object Properties:** Color, size, and material properties of objects.
*   **Camera Properties:** Position, orientation, and field of view of the camera.
*   **Distractor Objects:** Adding random objects to the scene to act as clutter.

The goal is to make the real world appear to the model as just another variation of the simulated domain.

## Domain Randomization in Isaac Sim

NVIDIA Isaac Sim has built-in tools for domain randomization, making it easy to apply these variations to your synthetic data generation pipeline. This is a key technique for training robust perception models that transfer well from simulation to the real world.
