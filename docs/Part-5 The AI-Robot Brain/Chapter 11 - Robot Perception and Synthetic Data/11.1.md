# 11.1: Computer Vision in Robots

## The Importance of Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. For robots, computer vision is the primary way they perceive and understand the world around them.

## Common Computer Vision Tasks in Robotics

*   **Object Detection:** Identifying the presence and location of objects in an image.
*   **Object Recognition:** Classifying detected objects into categories (e.g., "person", "chair", "table").
*   **Semantic Segmentation:** Assigning a label to every pixel in an image, allowing the robot to understand the scene at a granular level.
*   **3D Pose Estimation:** Determining the 3D position and orientation of an object in the world.
*   **Visual SLAM:** Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using visual input to build a map of an environment and track the robot's location within it.

## The Role of Deep Learning

Modern computer vision relies heavily on deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These networks can be trained on large datasets of images to learn to perform tasks like object detection and classification with high accuracy.

For robotics, this means we can train models to recognize specific objects the robot needs to interact with, identify people to avoid or interact with, and understand the general layout of a room.
