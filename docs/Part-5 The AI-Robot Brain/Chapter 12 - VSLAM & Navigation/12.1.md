# 12.1: What is SLAM?

## Simultaneous Localization and Mapping

SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. It is a technique used by robots and autonomous vehicles to build a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of their own location within that map.

SLAM is a fundamental problem in robotics, as it allows a robot to operate in an environment that has not been pre-mapped.

## The SLAM Process

The SLAM process is often described as a "chicken and egg" problem: to build a map, you need to know your location, but to know your location, you need to have a map. SLAM algorithms solve this problem by iteratively updating both the map and the robot's estimated location.

A typical SLAM system consists of the following components:

1.  **Perception:** The robot uses its sensors (e.g., LiDAR, cameras) to gather information about the environment.
2.  **Mapping:** The robot uses the sensor data to build a map of the environment. The map can be represented in various ways, such as a 2D grid map, a 3D point cloud, or a graph of features.
3.  **Localization:** The robot uses the map and the sensor data to estimate its own position and orientation (its "pose").
4.  **Loop Closure:** A key part of SLAM is loop closure, which is the ability to recognize a previously visited place. When a loop is closed, the robot can correct for accumulated drift in its estimated trajectory and improve the consistency of the map.

## Types of SLAM

There are many different types of SLAM algorithms, which can be broadly classified based on the type of sensors they use:

*   **LiDAR-based SLAM:** Uses LiDAR data to build a map. LiDAR provides accurate range measurements, which makes it well-suited for SLAM.
*   **Visual SLAM (VSLAM):** Uses camera data to build a map. VSLAM is more challenging than LiDAR-based SLAM, as it is more difficult to extract depth information from images. However, cameras are cheaper and more ubiquitous than LiDARs.
*   **Multi-sensor SLAM:** Combines data from multiple sensors, such as LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs, to achieve a more robust and accurate SLAM solution.
