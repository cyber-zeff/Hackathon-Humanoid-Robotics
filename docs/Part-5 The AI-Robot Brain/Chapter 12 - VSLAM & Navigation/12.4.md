# 12.4: Path Planning

Path planning is a core component of robot navigation. It is the process of finding a collision-free path from a starting point to a goal point. In the context of Nav2, this is handled by the global and local planners.

## Global Planners

The global planner is responsible for finding an optimal path in the static environment. It does not consider dynamic obstacles. Common global planning algorithms include:

*   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** A classic graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. In Nav2, the grid map is treated as a graph.
*   **A* (A-star):** An extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal, making it faster in many cases. This is the default planner in Nav2.
*   **RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star):** A sampling-based algorithm that is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces.

## Local Planners (Controllers)

The local planner, or controller, is responsible for generating the velocity commands for the robot's base. Its job is to follow the global path as closely as possible while reacting to dynamic obstacles that appear in the local costmap.

Common local planning algorithms include:

*   **Dynamic Window Approach (DWA):** This algorithm works by sampling a set of possible velocities in a "dynamic window" around the robot's current velocity. Each sampled velocity is then evaluated based on how well it follows the path, avoids obstacles, and makes progress towards the goal.
*   **Timed Elastic Band (TEB):** This algorithm models the robot's trajectory as an "elastic band" that is stretched between the robot's current position and the goal. The algorithm then optimizes the shape of this band to satisfy constraints such as avoiding obstacles and respecting the robot's kinematic limits.
*   **Model Predictive Control (MPC):** A more advanced control technique that uses a model of the robot's dynamics to predict its future motion and select the control inputs that will optimize its behavior over a certain time horizon.

The choice of planners and their configuration depends heavily on the robot's kinematics, dynamics, and the specific requirements of the application.
