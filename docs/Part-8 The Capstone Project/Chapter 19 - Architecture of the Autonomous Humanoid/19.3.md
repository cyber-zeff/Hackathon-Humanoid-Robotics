# 19.3: Navigation

## Moving Through the World: The Navigation System

The navigation system of an autonomous humanoid robot is responsible for enabling it to move safely and efficiently from one location to another within its environment. It integrates information from perception and planning to execute movement commands.

## Key Components of a Navigation System

As discussed in Chapter 12 with Nav2, a typical navigation system consists of several interconnected modules:

1.  **Mapping:**
    *   **Purpose:** To create and maintain a representation of the environment.
    *   **Techniques:** Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is used to build maps of unknown environments. Maps can be 2D occupancy grid maps (for path planning) or 3D point clouds (for detailed perception).
    *   **Inputs:** LiDAR, camera data, depth sensors.

2.  **Localization:**
    *   **Purpose:** To determine the robot's precise position and orientation within the map.
    *   **Techniques:** Algorithms like Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) or Kalman filters are used to estimate the robot's pose from sensor readings and map data. Visual odometry or VSLAM can also contribute.
    *   **Inputs:** Sensor data (LiDAR, camera, IMU), map.

3.  **Path Planning:**
    *   **Global Planner:** Generates a long-term, collision-free path from the start to the goal, considering the static obstacles in the map.
    *   **Local Planner (Controller):** Generates short-term, dynamic trajectories and velocity commands that follow the global path while avoiding dynamic obstacles in the immediate vicinity.
    *   **Inputs:** Current robot pose, goal pose, map, real-time sensor data (for local obstacles).

4.  **Obstacle Avoidance:**
    *   **Purpose:** To prevent collisions with both static and dynamic obstacles.
    *   **Techniques:** Real-time sensor data (LiDAR, depth cameras) is used to update local costmaps, which then inform the local planner.

## Humanoid-Specific Navigation Challenges

*   **Bipedal Locomotion:** Unlike wheeled robots, humanoids must maintain balance during locomotion. Navigation paths must be kinematically and dynamically feasible for bipedal walking.
*   **Uneven Terrain:** Humanoids are designed to traverse varied terrains, requiring advanced perception of traversability and robust gait adaptation.
*   **Human Presence:** Navigating in human environments means predicting human movement and interacting safely, often requiring "social navigation" behaviors.
*   **Whole-Body Motion:** The robot's arms and torso may need to be coordinated with its legs during navigation (e.g., to duck under obstacles or use arms for balance).

A robust navigation system allows the autonomous humanoid to autonomously move to target locations, bringing its manipulation and interaction capabilities to where they are needed.
