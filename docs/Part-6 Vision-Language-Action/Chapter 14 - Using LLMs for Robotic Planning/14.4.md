# 14.4: Challenges and Limitations

Despite the exciting potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for robotic planning, several significant challenges and limitations must be addressed before they can be reliably deployed in real-world, safety-critical applications.

## 1. Grounding and Embodiment

*   **Symbolic vs. Physical:** LLMs operate in a symbolic, linguistic space. Translating their abstract plans into concrete, physically realizable actions that account for the robot's kinematics, dynamics, and real-world physics is a major hurdle.
*   **Perception Gap:** LLMs don't "see" the world. They rely on sensory data provided to them. If the robot's perception system fails to correctly identify an object or its state, the LLM's plan will be based on flawed information.

## 2. Hallucinations and Factual Accuracy

*   **Generating Plausible but Incorrect Plans:** LLMs can "hallucinate," generating plans that sound plausible but are physically impossible, inefficient, or unsafe for the robot. They lack inherent mechanisms to verify the physical feasibility of their outputs.
*   **Lack of Causal Understanding:** While LLMs can infer relationships from data, they don't possess true causal understanding. They might suggest an action that typically follows another in text, but isn't causally linked in the physical world.

## 3. Reliability and Safety

*   **Non-Deterministic Output:** LLMs can produce varied outputs for the same prompt, making their behavior less predictable than traditional programmatic control. This non-determinism is problematic for safety-critical tasks.
*   **Safety Guarantees:** Ensuring that an LLM-generated plan will not lead to self-damage, damage to the environment, or harm to humans is extremely difficult and an active area of research. Guardrails and validation mechanisms are crucial.

## 4. Computational Cost and Latency

*   **Resource Intensive:** Running large LLMs, especially in real-time on robot hardware, can be computationally expensive and may introduce unacceptable latency for time-sensitive robotic operations.
*   **Energy Consumption:** The power requirements for continuously running powerful LLMs on mobile platforms can be prohibitive.

## 5. Domain Specialization

*   **Generalist vs. Specialist:** While LLMs are powerful generalists, they may not always outperform specialized, optimized algorithms for specific, well-defined robotic tasks (e.g., a dedicated path planner).
*   **Data Bias:** If the training data for the LLM contains biases, these can be reflected in the robot's planning decisions.

Overcoming these limitations will require significant advancements in grounding mechanisms, robust verification techniques, efficient on-robot deployment of LLMs, and innovative ways to combine LLM capabilities with traditional robotic control and sensing paradigms.
