# 5.1: ROS 2 Architecture

## What is ROS 2?

ROS (Robot Operating System) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS 2 is a redesigned version of ROS that brings new features and improvements, such as support for real-time systems, smaller memory footprint, and improved security.

## The ROS 2 Graph

The fundamental concept in ROS 2 is the **graph**. The ROS 2 graph is the network of ROS 2 nodes and the connections between them. It describes how the different parts of the robot's software system communicate with each other.

The key components of the ROS 2 graph are:

*   **Nodes:** A node is a process that performs some computation. A ROS 2 system is typically composed of many nodes, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., controlling a motor, reading a sensor, planning a path).
*   **Topics:** Nodes communicate with each other by publishing messages to and subscribing to topics. A topic is a named bus over which messages are sent.
*   **Services:** For request-response interactions, nodes can use services. A service has a single server that provides the service and one or more clients that use it.
*   **Actions:** Actions are used for long-running tasks that provide feedback. An action has a goal, feedback, and a result.

## DDS/RTPS

Under the hood, ROS 2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) as its communication middleware. DDS is an industry standard for real-time and reliable data exchange. This is a major change from ROS 1, which used a custom communication system.

Using DDS provides several benefits:

*   **Improved performance:** DDS is designed for high-performance, low-latency communication.
*   **Better scalability:** DDS is designed to scale to large and complex systems.
*   **Enhanced reliability:** DDS provides configurable reliability settings for data delivery.
*   **Interoperability:** DDS is a standard, which allows ROS 2 to interoperate with other DDS-based systems.
