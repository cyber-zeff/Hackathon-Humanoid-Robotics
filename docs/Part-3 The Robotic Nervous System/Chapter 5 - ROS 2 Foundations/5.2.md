# 5.2: Nodes

## What is a ROS 2 Node?

A node is the fundamental building block of a ROS 2 system. It is a process that performs some computation. In a real-world robotics system, you would typically have many nodes, each responsible for a single, well-defined task.

For example, in a humanoid robot, you might have separate nodes for:

*   Controlling the motors in the legs.
*   Reading data from the IMU sensor.
*   Processing images from the camera.
*   Planning a path for the robot to follow.
*   Executing the planned path.

## Creating a Node

You can create a ROS 2 node by writing a program in Python or C++. The program must initialize the ROS 2 client library and then create a `Node` object.

Here is a simple example of a "Hello World" node in Python:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MyNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('my_node')
        self.get_logger().info('Hello, ROS 2!')

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = MyNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Running a Node

To run a ROS 2 node, you can use the `ros2 run` command:

```bash
ros2 run <package_name> <executable_name>
```

This command will find the specified executable in the given package and run it as a new node.

## Introspection

You can use the `ros2 node` command to get information about the running nodes in the system.

*   `ros2 node list`: List all the running nodes.
*   `ros2 node info <node_name>`: Get detailed information about a specific node, including its subscribers, publishers, services, and actions.
