# 6.2: Creating a ROS 2 Package

## What is a Package?

A ROS 2 package is a directory containing a collection of files related to a specific piece of functionality. A package may contain source code, launch files, configuration files, message definitions, and more.

Packages are the basic unit of organization in ROS 2. All ROS 2 code must be in a package.

## Package Structure

A ROS 2 package has a specific directory structure. The most important file in a package is the `package.xml` file. This file contains metadata about the package, such as its name, version, author, and dependencies.

A typical Python-based ROS 2 package might have the following structure:

```
my_package/
├── package.xml
├── setup.py
├── setup.cfg
└── my_package/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── my_node.py
```

## Creating a Package

You can create a new ROS 2 package using the `ros2 pkg create` command. You should run this command from the `src` directory of your workspace.

```bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python --node-name my_node my_package
```

This command will create a new directory called `my_package` with the basic structure of a Python ROS 2 package.

## `package.xml`

The `package.xml` file contains important information about the package. Here is an example of a simple `package.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<package format="3">
  <name>my_package</name>
  <version>0.0.0</version>
  <description>TODO: Package description</description>
  <maintainer email="user@todo.todo">user</maintainer>
  <license>TODO: License declaration</license>

  <depend>rclpy</depend>
  <depend>std_msgs</depend>

  <test_depend>ament_copyright</test_depend>
  <test_depend>ament_flake8</test_depend>
  <test_depend>ament_pep257</test_depend>
  <test_depend>python3-pytest</test_depend>

  <export>
    <build_type>ament_python</build_type>
  </export>
</package>
```

This file specifies the name of the package, its version, and its dependencies. You should edit this file to provide accurate information about your package.
