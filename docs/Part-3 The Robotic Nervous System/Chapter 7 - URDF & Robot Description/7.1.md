# 7.1: URDF Basics

## What is URDF?

URDF stands for Unified Robot Description Format. It is an XML format for representing a robot model. URDF is commonly used in ROS to describe the physical properties of a robot, such as its links, joints, and sensors.

A URDF file typically contains the following elements:

*   **`<robot>`:** The root element of the URDF file.
*   **`<link>`:** Describes a rigid part of the robot's body. A link has properties such as its mass, inertia, and visual and collision geometries.
*   **`<joint>`:** Describes the connection between two links. A joint has a type (e.g., revolute, prismatic, fixed), an axis of rotation, and limits.
*   **`<visual>`:** Describes the visual appearance of a link.
*   **`<collision>`:** Describes the collision geometry of a link, which is used for collision checking.
*   **`<inertial>`:** Describes the inertial properties of a link, such as its mass and inertia tensor.

## Example URDF

Here is an example of a simple URDF file for a two-link robotic arm:

```xml
<robot name="my_arm">
  <link name="base_link">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <cylinder length="0.1" radius="0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <link name="link1">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.5 0.1 0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <joint name="joint1" type="revolute">
    <parent link="base_link"/>
    <child link="link1"/>
    <origin xyz="0 0 0.05"/>
    <axis xyz="0 0 1"/>
    <limit lower="-3.14" upper="3.14" effort="10" velocity="1"/>
  </joint>

  <link name="link2">
    <visual>
      <geometry>
        <box size="0.5 0.1 0.1"/>
      </geometry>
    </visual>
  </link>

  <joint name="joint2" type="revolute">
    <parent link="link1"/>
    <child link="link2"/>
    <origin xyz="0.5 0 0"/>
    <axis xyz="0 1 0"/>
    <limit lower="-3.14" upper="3.14" effort="10" velocity="1"/>
  </joint>
</robot>
```

## Visualizing a URDF

You can use RViz, the ROS 3D visualization tool, to visualize a URDF model. You will need to launch the `robot_state_publisher` node, which reads the URDF file and publishes the robot's state to the `/robot_description` topic.
