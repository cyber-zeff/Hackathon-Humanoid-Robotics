# 7.3: Modeling Humanoid Robots

Modeling a humanoid robot is a complex task that requires careful attention to detail. The model must accurately represent the robot's kinematics, dynamics, and visual appearance.

## Creating the URDF

The first step in modeling a humanoid robot is to create a URDF file that describes its structure. This involves defining all the links and joints of the robot, as well as their properties.

It is a good practice to create a separate URDF file for each part of the robot (e.g., a leg, an arm, the torso) and then combine them into a single file using Xacro.

## Meshes for Visual and Collision Geometries

For a realistic-looking model, you should use 3D mesh files for the visual and collision geometries of the robot's links. The visual meshes are typically high-polygon models that accurately represent the appearance of the robot, while the collision meshes are low-polygon, simplified versions that are used for collision checking.

Common mesh formats used in ROS are STL and DAE (Collada).

## Inertial Properties

Accurately specifying the inertial properties of each link (mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor) is crucial for realistic simulation and for model-based control. These properties can be determined from the CAD model of the robot or through experimental identification.

## Adding Sensors

You can also add sensors to your robot model, such as cameras, IMUs, and LiDARs. This is typically done by adding extra links and joints to the URDF and then using a sensor-specific plugin in Gazebo to simulate the sensor's behavior.
